			In all the preceding lessons, you have learned how to write the 
			program code in Visual Studio 2013


 but we have not discuss the 
			concepts of object oriented programming that forms the foundation of 
			Visual Studio 2013


. Now, let’s get down to learning the basic 
			concepts of object oriented programming.<p class="auto-style1"></p>
			<p class="auto-style1">In order for a programming language to 
			qualify as an object oriented programming language, it must have 
			three core technologies namely encapsulation, inheritance and 
			polymorphism. These three terms are explained below:</p>
		</div>
		<div class="auto-style1">
			<br />
   	<p class="auto-style1"><strong class="auto-style1">Encapsulation</strong><br />
	Encapsulation refers to the creation of self-contained modules that bind 
	processing functions to the data. These user-defined data types are called 
	classes. Each class contains data as well as a set of methods which 
	manipulate the data. The data components of a class are called instance 
	variables and one instance of a class is an object. For example, in a 
	library system, a class could be member, and John and Sharon could be two 
	instances (two objects) of the library class.</p>
	<p class="auto-style1"><strong class="auto-style1">Inheritance</strong><br />
	Classes are created according to hierarchies, and inheritance allows the 
	structure and methods in one class to be passed down the hierarchy. That 
	means less programming is required when adding functions to complex systems. 
	If a step is added at the bottom of a hierarchy, then only the processing 
	and data associated with that unique step needs to be added. Everything else 
	about that step is inherited.</p>
	<p class="auto-style1"><strong class="auto-style1">Polymorphism</strong></p>
	<div id="mycontent0" class="auto-style1">
		<div class="auto-style1">
			Object-oriented programming allows procedures about objects to be 
			created whose exact type is not known until runtime. For example, a 
			screen cursor may change its shape from an arrow to a line depending 
			on the program mode. The routine to move the cursor on screen in 
			response to mouse movement would be written for “cursor,” and 
			polymorphism allows that cursor to take on whatever shape is 
			required at runtime. It also allows new shapes to be easily 
			integrated.Visual Studio 2013


 allows users to write programs that 
			break down into modules. These modules represents the real-world 
			objects and are knows as classes or types. An object can be created 
			out of a class and it is known as an instance of the class. A class 
			can also comprise subclass. For example, apple tree is a subclass of 
			the plant class and the apple in your backyard is an instance of the 
			apple tree class. Another example is student class is a subclass of 
			the human class while your son John is an instance of the student 
			class.</div>
		<div class="auto-style1">
			<br />
    	<p class="auto-style1">A class consists of data members as well as methods. 
	In Visual Studio 2013


, the program structure to define a Human class can be 
	written as follows:</p>
	<p class="auto-style1"><strong>Public Class Human<br />
	‘Data Members<br />
	Private Name As String<br />
	Private Birthdate As String<br />
	Private Gender As String<br />
	Private Age As Integer<br />
	‘Methods</strong></p>
	<p class="auto-style1"><strong>Overridable Sub ShowInfo( )</strong></p>
	<p class="auto-style1"><strong>MessageBox.Show(Name)<br />
	MessageBox.Show(Birthdate)<br />
	MessageBox.Show(Gender)<br />
	MessageBox.Show(Age)</strong></p>
	<p class="auto-style1"><strong>End Sub<br />
	End Class</strong></p>
	<p class="auto-style1"><strong>Another Example:</strong></p>
	<p class="auto-style1"><strong>Public Class Car<br />
	‘Data Members<br />
	Private Brand As String<br />
	Private Model As String<br />
	Private Year Made As String<br />
	Private Capacity As Integer</strong></p>
	<p class="auto-style1"><strong>‘Methods</strong></p>
	<p class="auto-style1"><strong>Overridable Sub ShowInfo( )</strong></p>
	<p class="auto-style1"><strong>MessageBox.Show(Brand)<br />
	MessageBox.Show(Model)<br />
	MessageBox.Show(Year Made)<br />
	MessageBox.Show(Capacity)</strong></p>
	<p class="auto-style1"><strong>End Sub<br />
	End Class</strong></p>
	<p class="auto-style1">Let’s look at one example on how to create a class. 
	The following example shows you how to create a class that can calculate 
	your BMI (Body Mass Index).</p>
	<p class="auto-style2">To create class, start Visual Studio 2013


 as usual and 
	choose Windows Applications. In the Visual Studio 2013


 IDE, click on Project 
	on the menu bar and select Add Class, the Add New Item dialog appears, as 
	shown in Figure 24.1<a class="auto-style1" href="Images/vb2013_figure24.1.jpg"><img alt="vb2013_figure24.1" class="auto-style1" height="614" src="Images/vb2013_figure24.1.jpg" width="955" /></a><strong class="auto-style1">Figure 
	24.1</strong></p>
	<p class="auto-style1">The default class Class1.vb will appear as a new tab 
	with a code window. Rename the class as MyClass.vb. Rename the form as 
	MyFirstClass.vb.</p>
	<p class="auto-style1">Now, in the MyClass.vb window, create a new class 
	MyClass1 and enter the following code</p>
	<p class="auto-style1"><strong>Public Class MyClass1<br />
	Public Function BMI(ByVal height As Single, ByVal weight As Single)</strong></p>
	<p class="auto-style1"><strong>BMI = Format((weight) / (height ^ 2), “0.00”)</strong></p>
	<p class="auto-style1"><strong>End Function<br />
	End Class</strong></p>
	<p class="auto-style1">Now you have created a class (an object) called 
	MyClass1 with a method known as BMI.</p>
	<p class="auto-style1">In order to use the BMI class, &nbsp;insert a button into 
	the form and click on the button to enter the following code:</p>
	<p class="auto-style1"><strong>Private Sub BtnBMI_Click(sender As Object, e As 
	EventArgs) Handles BtnBMI.Click<br />
	Dim MyObject As Object<br />
	Dim h, w As Single<br />
	MyObject = New MyClass1()<br />
	h = InputBox(“What is your height in meter”)<br />
	w = InputBox(“What is your weight in kg”)<br />
	MessageBox.Show(MyObject.BMI(h, w))<br />
	End Sub</strong></p>
	<p class="auto-style1">When you run this program and click the button, the 
	user will be presented with two input boxes to enter his or her height and 
	weight&nbsp;subsequently and the value of BMI will be shown in a pop-up message 
	box, as shown in the figures below:</p>
