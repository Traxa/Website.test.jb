	<strong>[Lesson 30]</strong></a></h2>
	<p class="auto-style1">We have learned how to create the Graphics and the 
	Pen objects to draw rectangle, ellipse ,circle and text in the preceding 
	lessons, now we shall learn how to draw polygons and pie in Visual basic 
	2013 IDE.</p>
	<h2 class="auto-style1">29.1: Drawing Polygons</h2>
	<p class="auto-style1">Polygon is a closed plane figure bounded by three or 
	more straight sides. In order to draw a polygon on the screen, we need to 
	define the coordinates of all the points (also known as vertices) that 
	joined up to form the pollygon. The syntax to defines the points of a 
	polygon with vertices A1,A2,A3,A4…….An is as follows;</p>
	<div id="mycontent" class="auto-style1">
		<div class="auto-style1">
			<strong>Dim A1 As New Point(X1,Y1)</strong><p class="auto-style1"></p>
			<p class="auto-style1"><strong>Dim A2 As New Point(X2,Y2)</strong></p>
			<p class="auto-style1"><strong>Dim A3 As New Point(X3,Y3)</strong></p>
			<p class="auto-style1"><strong>Dim A4 As New Point(X4,Y4)</strong></p>
			<p class="auto-style1"><strong>Dim An as New Point(Xn,Yn)</strong></p>
		</div>
		
	</div>
	<p class="auto-style1">After declaring the points, we need to define a point 
	structure that group all the points together using the following syntax: Dim 
	myPoints As Point() = {A1, A2, A3,….,An} .Finally, create the graphics 
	object and use the DrawPolygon method to draw the polygon using the 
	following syntax:<br />
	<strong>Dim myGraphics As Graphics = Me.CreateGraphics<br />
	myGraphics.DrawPolygon(myPen, myPoints)</strong></p>
	<p class="auto-style1">where myPen is the Pen object created using the 
	following syntax:<br />
	<strong>myPen = New Pen(Drawing.Color.Blue, 5)</strong></p>
	<p class="auto-style1"><strong class="auto-style1">Example 29.1 :Drawing a 
	Triangle</strong><br />
	A triangle is a polygon with three vertices. Here is the code:</p>
	<p class="auto-style1"><strong>Private Sub BtnDraw_Click(sender As Object, e As 
	EventArgs) Handles BtnDraw.Click</strong></p>
	<p class="auto-style1"><strong>Dim myPen As Pen<br />
	Dim A As New Point(10, 10)<br />
	Dim B As New Point(100, 50)<br />
	Dim C As New Point(60, 150)<br />
	Dim myPoints As Point() = {A, B, C}<br />
	myPen = New Pen(Drawing.Color.Blue, 5)<br />
	Dim myGraphics As Graphics = Me.CreateGraphics<br />
	myGraphics.DrawPolygon(myPen, myPoints)</strong></p>
	<p class="auto-style1"><strong>End Sub</strong></p>
	<p class="auto-style1">Running the program produces the image as shown in 
	Figure 29.1</p>

		<div class="auto-style1">
  	<p class="auto-style1"><strong class="auto-style1">Example 29.2: Drawing a 
	Quadrilateral</strong><br />
	A quadrilateral is a polygon consists of four sides,so you need to define 
	four vertices. The code is as follows:</p>
	<p class="auto-style1"><strong>Private Sub BtnDraw_Click(sender As Object, e As 
	EventArgs) Handles BtnDraw.Click</strong></p>
	<p class="auto-style1"><strong>Dim myPen As Pen Dim A As New Point(10, 10)<br />
	Dim B As New Point(100, 50)<br />
	Dim C As New Point(120, 150)<br />
	Dim D As New Point(60, 200)<br />
	Dim myPoints As Point() = {A, B, C, D}<br />
	myPen = New Pen(Drawing.Color.Blue, 5)<br />
	Dim myGraphics As Graphics = Me.CreateGraphics<br />
	myGraphics.DrawPolygon(myPen, myPoints)</strong></p>
	<p class="auto-style1"><strong>End Sub</strong></p>
	<p class="auto-style1">The output image is as shown in Figure 29.2<br />
	</p>
	<center class="auto-style1">
	<img alt="" class="auto-style1" height="300" src="Images/lesson25_2.jpg" width="300" /><br />
	<strong class="auto-style1">Figure 29.2</strong></center>
	<p class="auto-style1"></p>
	<h2 class="auto-style1"><strong class="auto-style1">29.2: Drawing a Pie</strong></h2>
	<p class="auto-style1">In order to draw a pie, you can use the DrawPie 
	method of the graphics object. As usual, you need to create the Graphics and 
	the Pen objects. The syntax for drawing a pie is: </p>
	<p class="auto-style1"><strong>myGraphics.DrawPie(myPen, X, Y, width,height, 
	StartAngle, SweepAngle)</strong></p>
	<p class="auto-style1">Where X and Y are the coordinates the bounding 
	rectangle, other arguments are self-explanatory. Both StartAngle and 
	SweepAngle are measured in degree. SweepAngle can take possible or negative 
	values. If the value is positive, it sweep through clockwise direction while 
	negative means it sweep through anticlockwise direction.</p>
	<p class="auto-style1"><strong class="auto-style1">Example 29.3: Drawing a 
	pie that starts with 0 degree and sweep clockwise through 60 degree.</strong>
	</p>
	<p class="auto-style1"><strong>Private Sub BtnDraw_Click(sender As Object, e As 
	EventArgs) Handles BtnDraw.Click</strong></p>
	<p class="auto-style1"><strong>Dim myPen As Pen myPen = New Pen(Drawing.Color.Blue, 
	5)<br />
	Dim myGraphics As Graphics = Me.CreateGraphics<br />
	myGraphics.DrawPie(myPen, 50,50, 150,150,0,60)</strong></p>
	<p class="auto-style1"><strong>End Sub</strong></p>
	<p class="auto-style1">The output image is as shown in Figure 29.3</p>
	<p class="auto-style1">
