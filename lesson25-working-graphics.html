	<h2 class="auto-style1">25.1 Introduction</h2>
	<p class="auto-style1">Creating graphics is easy in earlier versions of 
	Visual Basic because they have built-in drawing tools. For example, In 
	Visual Basic 6, the drawing tools are included in the toolbox where the 
	programmer just need to drag the shape controls into the form to create 
	rectangle, square, ellipse,circle and more. However, its simplicity has the 
	shortcomings, you donâ€™t have many choices in creating customized drawings.</p>
	<div id="mycontent" class="auto-style1">
		<div class="auto-style1">
			Since Visual Basic evolved into an object oriented programming 
			language under the VB.net framework, shape controls are no longer 
			available. Now the programmer needs to write code to create various 
			shapes and drawings. Even though the learning curve is steeper, the 
			programmer can write powerful code to create all kinds of graphics. 
			You can even design your own controls<p class="auto-style1"></p>
			<p class="auto-style1">Visual Studio 2013


 offers various graphics 
			capabilities that enable programmers to write code that can create 
			all kinds of shapes and even fonts. In this lesson,you will learn 
			how to write code to draw lines and shapes on the Visual Studio 2013


 
			IDE.</p>

   	<h2 class="auto-style1"><strong class="auto-style1">25.2 Creating the 
	Graphics Object</strong></h2>
	<p class="auto-style1">Before you can draw anything on a form, you need to 
	create the Graphics object in Visual Studio 2013


. A graphics object is 
	created using the <strong class="auto-style1">CreateGraphics()</strong> 
	method. You can create a graphics object that draw to the form itself or a 
	control.<br />
	To draw graphics on the default form, you can use the following statement:<strong class="auto-style1">Dim 
	myGraphics As Graphics =me.CreateGraphics</strong>To draw in a picture box, 
	you can use the following statement:</p>
	<p class="auto-style1"><strong>Dim myGraphics As 
	Graphics = PictureBox1.CreateGraphics</strong></p>
	<p class="auto-style1">You can also use the text box as a drawing surface, 
	the statement is:</p>
	<p class="auto-style1"><strong class="auto-style1">Dim myGraphics As 
	Graphics = TextBox1.CreateGraphics</strong></p>
	<p class="auto-style1">The Graphics object that is created does not draw 
	anything on the screen until you call the methods of the Graphics object. In 
	addition,you need to create the Pen object as the drawing tool. We shall 
	examine the code that can create a pen in the following section.</p>
	<h2 class="auto-style1"><strong class="auto-style1">25.3 Creating a Pen</strong></h2>
	<p class="auto-style1">A Pen can be created using the following code:</p>
	<p class="auto-style1"><strong class="auto-style1">myPen = New 
	Pen(Brushes.Color, LineWidth)</strong></p>
	<p class="auto-style1">where myPen is a Pen variable. You can use any 
	variable name instead of myPen. The first argument of the pen object defines 
	the color of the drawing line and the second argument defines the width of 
	the drawing line. For example, the following code created a pen that can 
	draw a dark magenta line and the width of the line is 10 pixels:</p>
	<p class="auto-style1"><strong class="auto-style1">myPen = New 
	Pen(Brushes.DarkMagenta, 10)</strong></p>
	<p class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style5">You can also create a Pen 
	using the following statement:</span></p>
	<p class="auto-style1"><strong class="auto-style1">Dim myPen As Pen</strong></p>
	<p class="auto-style1"><strong class="auto-style1">myPen = New 
	Pen(Drawing.Color.Blue, 5)</strong></p>
	<p class="auto-style1">Where the first argument define the color(here is 
	blue, you can change that to red or whatever color you want) and the second 
	argument is the width of the drawing line.</p>
	<p class="auto-style1">Having created the Graphics and the Pen objects, you 
	are now ready to draw graphics on the screen which we will show you in the 
	following section.</p>
	<h2 class="auto-style1"><strong class="auto-style1">25.4 Drawing a Line</strong></h2>
	<p class="auto-style1">In this section, we will show you how to draw a 
	straight line on the Form.</p>
	<p class="auto-style1">First of all, launch Visual Studio 2013


 Express. In 
	the start up page, drag a button into the form. Double click on the button 
	and key in the following code.</p>
	<p class="auto-style1">P<strong>rivate Sub BtnDraw_Click(sender As Object, e As 
	EventArgs) Handles BtnDraw.Click<br />
	Dim myGraphics As Graphics = Me.CreateGraphics</strong></p>
	<p class="auto-style1"><strong>Dim myPen As Pen</strong></p>
	<p class="auto-style1"><strong>myPen = New Pen(Brushes.DarkMagenta, 20)</strong></p>
	<p class="auto-style1"><strong>myGraphics.DrawLine(myPen, 60, 180, 220, 50)<br />
	End Sub</strong></p>
	<p class="auto-style1">The second created the Graphics object and the third 
	and fourth line create the Pen object. The fifth draw a line on the Form 
	using the DrawLine method. The first argument use the Pen object created by 
	you, the second argument and the third arguments define the coordinate the 
	starting point of the line, the fourth and the last arguments define the 
	ending coordinate of the line. The syntax of the Drawline argument is</p>
	<p class="auto-style1"><strong class="auto-style1">object.DrawLine(Pen, x1, 
	y1, x2, y2)</strong></p>
	<p class="auto-style1">For the above example, the starting coordinate is 
	(60,80) and the ending coordinate is (220,50)</p>
	<p class="auto-style1">Figure 25.1 shows the line created by the program.</p>
