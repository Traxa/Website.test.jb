	<p class="auto-style1">In previous lesson, we have learned how to design the 
	user interface by adding controls to the form and changing their properties. 
	However, the controls on user interface alone will not work without adding 
	code to them. In this lesson, we shall learn how to write code for all the 
	controls so that they can interact with events triggered by the users. 
	Before learning how to write Visual Studio 2013


 code, let us dwell into the 
	concept of event-driven programming</p>
	<p class="auto-style1"><strong class="auto-style1">4.1 The Concept of 
	Event-Driven Programming</strong><br />
	Visual Studio 2013


 is an event driven programming language&nbsp;because&nbsp;we need to 
	write code to response to certain events triggered randomly by the user via 
	the controls on the form. These events do not occur in a certain order. The 
	events usually comprises but not limited to the user’s inputs. Some of the 
	events are load, click, double click, drag and drop, pressing the keys and 
	more.</p>
	<div id="mycontent" class="auto-style1">
		<div class="auto-style1">
			<p class="auto-style1">Every form and and every control you place on 
			the form has a set of events related to them.&nbsp;Some of the events are 
			load, click, double click, drag and drop, pressing the keys and 
			more. To view the events, double-click the control (object) on the 
			form to enter the code window. &nbsp;The default event will appear at the 
			top part on the right side of the code window. You need to click on 
			the default event to view other events associated with the control. 
			The code appears on the left side is the event procedure associated 
			with the load event. Figure 4.1 illustrates the event procedure load 
			associated with the default form .</p>

			To start writing code in Visual Studio 2013


, &nbsp;click on any part of 
			the form to go into the code window as shown in Figure 4.1. This is 
			the structure of an event procedure. In this case, the event 
			procedure is to load Form1 and it starts with&nbsp;<strong class="auto-style1">Private 
			Sub</strong>&nbsp;and end with&nbsp;<strong class="auto-style1">End Sub</strong>. 
			This procedure includes the Form1 class and the event&nbsp;<strong class="auto-style1">Load</strong>, 
			and they are bind together with an underscore, i.e. Form_Load. It 
			does nothing other than loading an empty form. To make the load 
			event does something, insert the statement<p class="auto-style1">
			</p>
			<p class="auto-style1"><strong>MsgBox( “Welcome to Visual Studio 2013


”)</strong></p>
			<p class="auto-style1"><strong>Public Class Form1Private Sub 
			Form1_Load(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As 
			System.EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load</strong></p>
			<p class="auto-style1"><strong>MsgBox( “My First Visual Studio 2013


 Program”)</strong></p>
			<p class="auto-style1"><strong>End Sub</strong></p>
			<p class="auto-style1"><strong>End Class</strong></p>

		<div class="auto-style1">

	<p class="auto-style1">When you run the program, a message &nbsp;box display the 
	text&nbsp;“My First Visual Studio 2013


 Program” will appear, as show in Figure 
	4.3. MsgBox is a built-in function in Visual Studio 2013


 that display a 
	message in a pop-up message box.</p>

	<p class="auto-style1">* You will notice that above Private Sub structure 
	there is a preceding keyword Public Class Form1. This is the concept of an 
	object oriented programming language.&nbsp;<span class="auto-style1">When we 
	start a windows application in Visual Studio 2013


, we will see a default form 
	with the name Form1 appears in the IDE, it is actually the Form1 Class that 
	inherits from the Form class&nbsp;</span><strong class="auto-style1">System.Windows.Forms.Form.&nbsp;</strong><span class="auto-style5">A 
	class has events as it creates an instant of a class or an object.&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="auto-style1">You can also write code to perform arithmetic 
	calculation. For example, you can use the MsgBox and the arithmetic operator 
	plus to perform an addition of two numbers, as shown below:</p>
	<p class="auto-style1"><strong>Private Sub Form1_Load(sender As Object, e As 
	EventArgs) Handles MyBase.LoadMsgBox(“2” &amp; “+” &amp; “5” &amp; “=” &amp; 2 + 5)End Sub</strong></p>
	<p class="auto-style1">*The symbol &amp; (<i class="auto-style1">ampersand) </i>
	is to perform&nbsp;string concatenation.</p>
	<p class="auto-style1">The output is as shown in Figure 4.4</p>
	<p class="auto-style2">

	4.4&nbsp;</strong></p>
	<p class="auto-style1">If you wish to close the window after the message, 
	you can add the statement&nbsp;<strong class="auto-style1">Me.Close(), </strong>
	as follows:</p>
	<p class="auto-style1"><strong>Private Sub Form1_Load(sender As Object, e As 
	EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load</strong></p>
	<p class="auto-style1"><strong>MsgBox(“2” &amp; “+” &amp; “5” &amp; “=” &amp; 2 + 5)<br />
