	<h2 class="auto-style1">33.1 Introduction to Database in Visual Studio 2013


</h2>
	<p class="auto-style1">In our daily life, we deal with many types of 
	information or data such as names, addresses, money, date, stock quotes, 
	statistics and more. If you are in business or working as a professional, 
	you have to handle even more data. For example, a doctor need to keep track 
	of patients’ personal and medical information such as names, addresses, 
	phone numbers as well as blood pressure readings, blood sugar 
	readings,surgical history, medicines prescribed in the past and more. On the 
	other hand, businesses usually have to manage large amount of data 
	pertaining to products and customers. All these data need to be organized 
	into a database for the ease of data management.</p>
	<div id="mycontent" class="auto-style1">
		<div class="auto-style1">
			In the past , people usually deal with data manually like using 
			cards and folders. However, in present day fast pace global 
			environment and Information age, it is no longer feasible to manage 
			data manually. Most data are now managed using computer-based 
			database management systems. Computer-based Database management 
			systems can handle data much faster and more efficient than human 
			beings do. With the advent of the network and the Internet 
			technologies, data can now be managed locally and remotely.Companies 
			usually invest heavily in database management systems in order to 
			run the organizations efficiently and effectively. </div>
		
	<p class="auto-style1">Database management systems are usually used in 
	running payroll system, inventory system, accounting system, payment system, 
	order handling system, customer relationship management system(CRM) and 
	more. Some of the commercial database management system(DBMS) are Oracle, 
	Microsoft SQL server and Microsoft Access </p>
	<h2 class="auto-style1">33.2 Creating a Database Application in Visual Basic 
	2012</h2>
	<p class="auto-style1">A database management system typically deals with 
	storing, modifying, and extracting information from a database. It can also 
	add, edit and delete records from the database. However, a DBMS can be very 
	difficult to handle by ordinary people or business men who have no 
	technological backgrounds. Fortunately, we can create user friendly database 
	applications to handle the aforementioned jobs with the DBMS running in the 
	background. One of the best programs that can create such database 
	application is none other than Visual Studio 2013


.</p>
	<p class="auto-style1">Visual Studio 2013


 uses ADO.NET to handle databases. 
	ADO.NET is Microsoft’s latest database technology which can works with many 
	other advanced database management system such as Microsoft SQL server. In 
	this lesson, we will develop codes that make use of Microsoft SQL Server 
	2012, therefore you need to have Microsoft SQL Server 2012 installed in your 
	PC, &nbsp;you can download&nbsp;Microsoft SQL Server 2012 Express &nbsp;for free&nbsp;&nbsp;from&nbsp;<a class="auto-style1" href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=29062" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=29062', 'http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=29062']);">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=29062</a>.</p>
	<div id="mycontent0" class="auto-style1">
		<div class="auto-style1">
			To begin building the database project in Visual Basic 2012, launch 
			Visual Basic 2012. You can name your project as Database Project 1 
			or what ever name you wish to call it. Next, change the default 
			form’s Text property to Contacts as we will be building a database 
			of contact list. There are a few objects in ADO.NET that are 
			required to build the database. There are:<p class="auto-style1">
			</p>
			<ul class="auto-style1">
				<li class="auto-style1"><strong class="auto-style1">
				SqlConnection</strong>– to connect to a data source in SQL 
				Server</li>
				<li class="auto-style1"><strong class="auto-style1">DataTable</strong> 
				-to store data for navigation and manipulation</li>
				<li class="auto-style1"><strong class="auto-style1">DataAdapter</strong>– 
				to populate a DataReader</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="auto-style1">
			<br />  	<p class="auto-style1">The aforementioned objects belongs to the System.Data 
	and the System.Xml namespace. Therefore, we need to reference them in the 
	beginning before we can work with them. To reference the ADO.NET object, 
	choose project from the menu then select Database Project 1 properties to 
	display the project properties. Next click the References tab to show the 
	active references for the project, as shown in Figure 33.1</p>

	33.1</strong></p>
	<p class="auto-style1">Under imported namespaces, make sure system.data, 
	System.Data.Sqlclient are selected, otherwise check them. Having done that 
	you need to click the Save All button on the toolbar and then return to the 
	Visual Studio 2013


 IDE.</p>
	<p class="auto-style1">We shall proceed to create connection to the database 
	source file in the next lesson.</p>
